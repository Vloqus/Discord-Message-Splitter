# Discord Message Splitter - Made by Jan

A sleek, fully customizable single-page web app that splits a long Discord message (over 2000 characters) into smaller parts. Each part can be easily copied with a click, featuring smooth tweened animations, a responsive layout, and a modern interface inspired by Microsoft design principles.

The app now includes an advanced settings menu that lets you adjust everything from the chunk size and border thickness to the font and animation speed‚Äîall of which automatically adapt to your chosen theme.
