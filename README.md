# Discord Message Splitter - Made by Jan

A sleek, fully customizable single-page web app that splits a long Discord message (over 2000 characters) into smaller parts. Each part can be easily copied by clicking, with smooth tweened animations and a stylish interface inspired by modern Microsoft design.
